# clj-thamil

clj-thamil is a Clojure library designed to be a multi-purpose library for Thamil
computing.

It can be used for natural language processing, designing input
methods, the UI for text editing, etc.

It can also be used as a basis for programming in Clojure in the
Thamil language.

Currently, it can support the following:
* programming in Clojure (programming language) in Thamil (natural language)
* natural language processing for Thamil language text
  * split a string into Thamil letters (not characters) and phonemes
  * combine a sequence of Thamil phonemes back into a proper Thamil string
  * sort letters, words, etc. by Thamil alphabetical order
  * convert a string between Thamil (Unicode format) and:
    * English-transliterated formats
    * TAB format
    * TSCII format
    * Bamini format
    * Webulagam format
  * basic grammar functions - pluralize, add suffixes, and add noun
    case suffixes
* perform a letter frequency analysis on input Thamil text

For examples of programming in Thamil (natural language), see:
* `test/clj_thamil/demo/core_test.clj` - a gradual
replacement of English into Thamil
* `test/clj_thamil/demo/trans_demo_01.cljc` - just about entirely
  in Thamil.  Demonstrates squaring numbers differently.
* `src/clj_thamil/மொழியியல்.cljc`- just about
entirely in Thamil.  Contains functions for basic grammar in Thamil
(making plurals, adding suffixes, adding noun case suffixes)

## Building

For both Clojure and ClojureScript, compiling, testing, and starting a
REPL can be done with the usual Leiningen commands `lein compile`,
`lein test`, and `lein repl`.

Compile the source into an executable JAR file (runnable on the JVM,
based on Clojure sources) using the command `lein uberjar`.  This is
all you need to do to run one of the standalone processes or
create a jar artifact.  `lein install` will install the artifact and
pom.xml into your local Maven cache.

## Usage

### Examples

#### Java Examples

The Java example code is in the Maven project in this repostiory at
[`examples/java/java-examples`](examples/java/java-examples/README.md).
See that page for instructions and building and running.

#### JavaScript Examples

The Clojure/-Script code in clj-thamil must be compiled using the
ClojureScript compiler into JavaScript before it can used in JS
runtimes (ex: webpages).  In the JS exmaples directory
[`examples/js`][(examples/js), first run `sh setup.sh`.  Then load the
HTML files located in the same directory from within a browser that
has JS enabled.

* test01.html - transliteration of English into Thamil on a JS popup box 
* test02.html - transliterates English into Thamil and splits Thamil into letter
* test03.html - sorting Thamil words by Thamil alphabetical order

### Command-line processes

#### Letter frequencies

The frequency analysis program (`freqs`) can be
run by
```
cat input | lein run freqs > output
```

The frequency analysis program
takes input from the standard input stream and outputs to the standard
output stream.

The code behind the letter frequency analysis can be found in the namespace
`clj-thamil.format.analysis`.

#### Phonemes

The text to phoneme converter program (`phonemes`) can be run by
```
cat input | lein run phonemes > output
```

The phonemes program
takes input from the standard input stream and outputs to the standard
output stream.

The code behind the phoneme conversion can be found in the namespaces `clj-thamil.subprograms` and `clj-thamil.format`.

## Editing

For programming in Thamil, if using a computer running Mac OS X, use
the Aquamacs program (a Mac OS X-friendly version of Emacs) to ensure that support for Thamil letters works
correctly.  If installing the `clojure-mode` package for Clojure
support in Aquamacs, find the `clojure-mode.el` file in your Aquamacs
MELPA/ELPA repository, and replace it with the file
`emacs/clojure-mode.el` in this repository.  Then load the newly-saved
`clojure-mode.el` file in the Aquamacs package repository into
Aquamacs, and run the command `M-x emacs-lisp-byte-compile-and-load`.
